> 💡 document everything

This repository is for useful documents. Please edit them.

### What?

Think of them like blog posts, but living. This is mainly for my own personal use; however, if an article isn't well written, or isn't correct, or needs to be redone, or could use editing, or could be made better, please add, refer, remix, remake, destroy, or otherwise transmute it into something else. Preferably in the shape of a PR.

### Contribute
